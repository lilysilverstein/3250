# README
This repository contains a set of Jupyter notebooks designed for use by students in Professor Silverstein's *MAT 3250 (Introduction to Number Theory)* course at Cal Poly Pomona. If you are not a student in this course, the purpose and use of this code will not be self-explanatory and is not intended to be.

For students in the class, refer to your homework assignments for more instructions. You can always download this repository and run it on a local Jupyter server (make sure to pull changes periodically). 

More conveniently, you can run the entire contents, interactively, in the cloud using the URL below:

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lilysilverstein/3250/master
  
Using this option, you do not need to install any software locally (but you do need an internet connection).
